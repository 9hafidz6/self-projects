        <!-- src can be absolute or relative
        1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. 
        Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

        Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, 
        you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images;
        it can suddenly be removed or changed.

        2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does
        not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the
        current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be 
        relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

        Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.-->
